# Multi-Step Form Project

This project is a multi-step form built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. The form is designed with client-side validation using React Hook Form and Zod. It includes light/dark mode support and features a dark mode toggle. The form collects user information in multiple steps, displays a review page before final submission, and then logs the collected data to the console while resetting the form.

## Features
